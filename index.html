                    <p>Pong 2: 3DS Edition is a homebrew game I developed for the Nintendo 3DS using C++ and the DevKitPro toolchain. The game was created as part of a personal project to learn more about game development and homebrew programming for handheld consoles as well as to give me a challenge.</p>
