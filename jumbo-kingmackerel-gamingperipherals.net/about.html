        <p class="about-paragraph">Jumbo King-Mackerel's Gaming Peripherals is a game peripherals design and manufacturing company that focuses on nostalgic controller designs. Our designs are based on existing nostalga-creating controllers such as the Nintendo 3DS, 2DS, and even the Wii Remote. Our goal is to give our customers a controller that can be used with a variety of both console games and PC games. These games include, but are not limited to Foxhole, Minecraft, any Nintendo DS game, and any Nintendo 3DS game.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">We also host a monthly sweepstakes competition known as the Jumbo K-Mack Sweepstakes. Each week three lucky winners will get the chance to win a prize selected through a poll on our social media. Previous prizes include game consoles, exclusive versions of our game controllers, and more!</p>
